Project name: Find a Doc

“Find a Doc” is a web application which lets you find a doctor appropriate for your specific condition and 
set up an appointment. The days of being lost and asking people what to do when a disease hits you is gone. 
Just Login-in choose the symptom which best fits your condition and the site will present you with a list of 
doctors closest to your location with their profile and all the appropriate information, and then you can set 
up an appointment with a doctor of your choice.

Project name: Find a Doc

“Find a Doc” is a web application which lets you find a doctor appropriate for your specific condition and 
set up an appointment. The days of being lost and asking people what to do when a disease hits you is gone. 
Just Login-in choose the symptom which best fits your condition and the site will present you with a list of 
doctors closest to your location with their profile and all the appropriate information, and then you can set 
up an appointment with a doctor of your choice. 

Technologies used:

For the front end development of the web application, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Java script was used. For the back end development, we used python and Django and for the database SQL Lite was used. Sublime text was used as a text editor.
